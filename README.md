# FlappyBird
A simple Flappy Bird simulation game built with Python and Pygame. Includes an AI autonomous playing feature, which can be enabled by clicking the 'Auto-solve' button in the UI.

Pygame is the only dependency for this project, and can be installed through pip:
`pip install pygame`

The game can be run through PyCharm, or any other Python environment with access to the system's graphical output.

Have fun!
